This\nmeans that a Gateway is based on the state of the GatewayClass at the time it\nwas created and changes to the GatewayClass or associated parameters are not\npropagated down to existing Gateways. This recommendation is intended to\nlimit the blast radius of changes to GatewayClass or associated parameters.\nIf implementations choose to propagate GatewayClass changes to existing\nGateways, that MUST be clearly documented by the implementation.\n\nWhenever one or more Gateways are using a GatewayClass, implementations SHOULD\nadd the `gateway-exists-finalizer.gateway.networking.k8s.io` finalizer on the\nassociated GatewayClass. This ensures that a GatewayClass associated with a\nGateway is not deleted while in use.\n\nGatewayClass is a Cluster level resource.",
